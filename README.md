## General Description
"Woodsy Wayfinder: Parcel Puzzles" immerses players in a strategic delivery challenge. The village, intertwined with multiple routes leading to various abodes, relies on the player to efficiently deliver packages. But it's not just about getting from point A to B. Players must meticulously arrange Tetris-like packages, prioritizing deliveries based on the delivery location on the map. The path selection becomes crucial as certain tiles within the routes are destructible, vanishing upon contact and having robbers placed all over the map, forcing players to strategize their delivery routes in subsequent runs.

Every decision, from package selection and stacking to route plotting, influences the outcome. With the ultimate goal of successfully delivering all packages by the end of the level, players are tested on their planning, adaptability, and puzzle-solving prowess, ensuring each delivery run is a unique experience
